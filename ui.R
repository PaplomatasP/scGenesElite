These include methods for identifying variable genes based on single cell RNA sequencing, statistical approaches based on p-value and LogFC threshold, and Feature Selection through tree-based ML models. A unique feature of this suite is the ability for the user to create their own ensemble method by combining one or more of these methods. Additionally, various threshold options are available for each method (for more information, consult the tutorial provided). It should be noted that each method employs a distinct approach and may require varying amounts of computational resources, depending on the size of the data. Therefore, it is recommended that the user employs preprocessing filters to reduce the data size and improve the reliability of the results. The normalization button allows the user to normalize their data prior to analysis. On the Ensemble tab, the options selected from the previous tabs for the various methods are applied. The genes identified through the analysis are depicted in a visual format utilizing both a barplot and a heatmap. The heatmap specifically uses cell type predict or State labeling as a method to organize and present the data. The state retains the labels provided in the dataset by the user, or the cell type prediction utilizes the singleR package for cell type annotation. Furthermore, a classification K-nearest neighbors (K-nn) model is executed to assess the ability of the model to accurately classify based solely on the isolated genes. The results of the K-NN analysis are presented in a comprehensive manner through the utilization of a confusion matrix and a data table."
